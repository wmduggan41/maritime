"""
Step 1: Data Simulation
Create a simple dataset simulating the mechanical systems variables: 
1) engine performance metrics
2) propulsion system health 
3) auxiliary system functionality

Step 2: Machine Learning Model
Employ a basic machine learning model, such as a decision tree classifier, to predict maintenance needs. 
This is a simplified approach for demonstration purposes.

Step 3: Prediction and Evaluation
Make predictions using our model and evaluate its performance with a confusion matrix and accuracy score.

# This matrix shows the number of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions.

# The accuracy is relatively low, which is expected given that our data is randomly generated and lacks the complexity 
# and patterns of real-world data. In a practical scenario, with actual historical data, the model would be more 
# sophisticated and trained to detect nuanced patterns, significantly improving accuracy. 
# This step serves as a foundational demonstration. In real applications, we would refine the model, use more 
# sophisticated algorithms, and employ techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to enhance performance.
